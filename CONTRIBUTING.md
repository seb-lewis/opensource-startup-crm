## Reporting Bugs

Please report bugs by opening an issue on our GitHub repository. When filing a bug report, please include:

- A clear and descriptive title
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Expected behavior
- Actual behavior
- Screenshots (if applicable)
- Environment information (OS, browser, etc.)

## Feature Requests

We welcome suggestions for new features! To suggest a feature:

1. Check if the feature has already been requested or is in development.
2. Open a new issue describing:
   - The feature you'd like to see
   - The problem it solves
   - How it should work
   - Why it would be valuable to most users

## Coding Standards

- We use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting and linting.
- Run `npm run lint` before submitting pull requests.
- Write meaningful comments and documentation.
- Follow the existing code style and patterns.
- Write tests for new functionality.

### Svelte Component Guidelines

- Each component should have a clear, single responsibility.
- Use Svelte's reactivity system effectively.
- Keep components reasonably sized; consider breaking large components into smaller ones.
- Use TypeScript for type safety when possible.

- Follow RESTful principles.
- Return consistent response structures.
- Handle errors gracefully and return appropriate status codes.
